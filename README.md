XPath is a general language to select elements from XML language.
While the HTML is an XML then we can use the XPath to find elements.

If we write more test the suites can get harder and harder to understand, so we introduce a level of organizing code.
We say that every page have it's own class that contains the actions that can be done on that page or information that can be claimed.

All of you have to do a big assignment that have to be presented in the future.

Our next big assignment will be a selenium test that tests a webpage that available publicly on the internet and choosen by you.
Every student has to have to choose different website.


There are many task that you can do, but there are obligatory tasks as well.
These tasks can be found in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lwZlTShULZVSCxM-ew880VkdSffrruTUF229c-FsC5k/edit?usp=sharing).
You will need to copy this spreadsheet and fill the yelllow zones.


The steps of the big assignment:

- Find a webpage that has login and some basic functionality that wasn't choosen by anybody yet. You can find here the reserved pages in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pVWcnxBJkw6f9679S2l4ZuaLa-QWQEEYAoFtjM3Bbw4/edit?usp=sharing).
- Fill [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeDvCWjhM4KrUV_1eQc45taf--5Uz798jruwcFd8vjvXVAyHg/viewform?usp=sf_link) about your webpage choose. By filling the form, your reserve will be added to the spreadsheet mentioned in the previous bullet point.
- Make your test program and publish on **Github** (Yes not on GitLab, now I ask you to use the public https://github.com/ to improve your visibility on the internet as programmer).
- Copy the [point spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lwZlTShULZVSCxM-ew880VkdSffrruTUF229c-FsC5k/edit?usp=sharing) and fill the github url and with the tasks that you have done.
- Present your solution.
If you cannot explain fully that you wrote and does not convince me that you wrote it the work is failed and you have to choose a new page and redo the task.

You have **3 weeks** to do the assignment. I will share presentation slots after 25th of April.
